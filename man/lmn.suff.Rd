\title{Calculate the sufficient statistics of an LMN model.}
\usage{
lmn.suff(Y, X, V, acf, npred = 0, debug = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{an (n x q) matrix.}

\item{X}{an (n x p) matrix. can also be passed as
\itemize{
   \item \code{X = 0}: in which case there is no intercept
   \item \code{X != 0}: in which case a scaled intercept X = X * matrix(1, n, 1)
   is assumed.
}}

\item{V}{Either: (1) an \code{n x n} full matrix, (2) an vector of length \code{n} such that \code{V = diag(V)}, (3) a scalar, such that \code{V = V * diag(n)}.}

\item{acf}{a vector of length n such that V = toeplitz(acf).}

\item{npred:}{an integer.  if nonzero, returns sufficient statistics to make predictions for \code{y | Y, Beta, Sigma} (see details).}
}
\value{
a list with the following elements:
\itemize{
   \item \code{Betahat = (t(X)V^{-1}X)^{-1}t(X)V^{-1}Y}
   \item \code{T = t(X)V^{-1}X}
   \item \code{S = t(Y-X*Betahat)V^{-1}(Y-X*Betahat)}
   \item \code{ldV = log(|V|)}
   \item \code{n = nrow(Y)}
   \item \code{noBeta} and \code{noSigma}
}
In addition, when \code{npred > 0}:
\itemize{
   \item \code{Ap = t(w)V^{-1}Y}
   \item \code{Xp = x - t(w)V^{-1}X}
   \item \code{Vp = v - t(w)V^{-1}w}
}

\description{
Calculate the sufficient statistics of an LMN model.
}
\details{
The model is defined as
\deqn{Y ~ MNorm(X*Beta, V, Sigma),}
where MNorm is the Matrix-Normal distribution, i.e.
\deqn{vec(Y) ~ N( vec(X*Beta), Sigma \otimes V ).}

The log-likelihood is
\deqn{ll(Beta, Sigma) = (-1/2) * ( trace( Sigma^{-1} ( S + t(Beta-B) T (Beta-B)) ) + n log(|Sigma|) + q ldV ).}
When \code{T = 0} and \code{S = 0} respectively, \code{Beta = 0} or \code{Sigma = diag(q)} is assumed to be known.

If \code{npred > 0}, summary statistics are produced for the prediction of \code{y} in
   \deqn{\code{YY = rbind(Y, y) ~ MNorm(XX*Beta, VV, Sigma)},}
   where \code{VV = rbind(cbind(V, w), cbind(t(w), v))} and \code{XX = rbind(X, x)}.
   In this case the inputs are \code{Y}, \code{V = VV} and \code{X = XX}. The predictive distribution for new observations y is
\deqn{y | Y ~ MNorm(Ap + Xp * Beta, Vp, Sigma).}
\code{Xp = 0} indicates that \code{Beta = 0} is known.
