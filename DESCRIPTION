Description: Efficient Frequentist profiling and Bayesian marginalization of parameters for which the conditional likelihood is that of a multivariate linear regression model.  Arbitrary inter-observation error correlations are supported, with optimized calculations provided for independent-heteroskedastic and stationary dependence structures.
