Description: Many statistical models have a subset of parameters which, conditioned on the others, has the likelihood function of a linear regression model.  This package provides tools to efficiently treat the members of this subset as "nuisance" parameters, either by profiling or integrating them out.  The latter is under a conjugate Matrix-Normal Inverse-Wishart (MNIW) distribution.  While arbitrary error correlations are supported,  optimized calculations are provided for Independent-Heteroscedastic and Stationary-Correlated error structures.
